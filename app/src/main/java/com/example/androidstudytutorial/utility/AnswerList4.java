            "\t\t\t For example, when the user taps a button to launch an activity, a new instance of that activity will be created each time. This is the default launch mode and is suitable for most activities.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "3.  SingleTask: The singleTask launch mode creates a new instance of an activity and places it in a new task. If an instance of the activity already exists, it is brought to the foreground and any other activities are destroyed. \n" +
            "\t\t\t For example, if the user launches a task-specific activity such as a settings activity, a new task is created and the existing instance of the activity is brought to the foreground, while any other activities in the previous task are destroyed.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "4.  SingleInstance: The singleInstance launch mode creates a new instance of an activity and places it in a new task. The new task can only contain a single activity and no other activities can be launched within that task. \n" +
            "\t\t\tFor example, an activity such as a login screen might use the singleInstance launch mode so that it is always the only activity in its task and cannot be launched again from within another task.\n" +
